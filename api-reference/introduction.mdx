## Getting Started

Welcome to the Omni Photo Studio API. Our RESTful API allows you to integrate AI-powered image generation capabilities into your applications, websites, and services. Generate images, enhance photos, and manage content programmatically.

## Authentication

The Omni Photo Studio API uses API keys for authentication. You can manage your API keys in your [Dashboard](https://omniphotostudio.com/dashboard/api-keys).

Include your API key in requests by adding it as an `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.omniphotostudio.com/v1/generate
```

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.omniphotostudio.com/v1
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are limited based on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Requests per Minute | Requests per Day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 10 | 100 |
| Pro | 100 | 10,000 |
| Enterprise | 1,000 | Unlimited |

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The number of allowed requests in the current period |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of remaining requests in the current period |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets |
